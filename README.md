# Vectors_model_and_text_processing
This repo is part of my notes and exercise from the Udemy course : [Natural Language Processing in Python (V2)](https://www.udemy.com/course/natural-language-processing-in-python/). This repo the summarized notes from the Section 3: Vectors models and Text Preprocessing. This includes:
* Basic definitions for NLP (Token/Tokenizations, Characters, N-Gram, vectors, BoW)
* Tokenization (Word based and Character based Tokenization)
* Stopwords
* Stemming and Lemmatization
* Vector Similarity (Euclidean Distance & cosine distance)
* Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
* Word to Index Mapping
* Neural Word Embeddings (word2vac & Glove)
